A Juju charm deploying Pollen on a machine. Pollen is a scalable,
high performance, free software (AGPL) web server, that provides small
strings of entropy, over TLS-encrypted HTTPS or clear text HTTP connections.
You might think of this as 'Entropy-as-a-Service'.

Pollinate is a free software (GPLv3) script that retrieves entropy from one
or more Pollen servers and seeds the local Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG).
You might think of this as PRNG-seeding via Entropy-as-a-Service.

This charm simplifies initial deployment and operations of Pollen
on a machine, such as scaling the number of instances and clustering and more.
As such, the charm makes it easy for those looking to take control of their own
entropy generation whilst keeping operations simple.

For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating Pollen simple and
straightforward through Jujuâ€™s clean interface. It will allow easy deployment
into multiple environments for testing of changes, and supports scaling out for
enterprise deployments.
